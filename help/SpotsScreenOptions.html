<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">Directly under the Vehicle dropdown are various options that control what is displayed on the Spots screen. The different views are explained below.</span></p>

 <ul style="text-indent: 0px; padding: 0; margin: 0 0 0 48px; list-style-position: outside; list-style-type: circle;">
  <li style="margin-left: 0px" class="rvps9"><span class="rvts11">None</span><span class="rvts12">: When the default is left to None, you will see the time, avail name, spot length, advertiser and product for each spot.</span></li>

 </ul>
 <li class="rvps4"><span class="rvts11">View</span><span class="rvts12">: The Spots Screen defaults to a weekly view, but that view can be changed to a 24 hour view by selecting “Daily” (the Daily View is also the default view when the system is designated as being used for a Radio Station.) There is more information about the Daily view in a later section of this document. If a spot is selected on the Spots screen, an additional option labeled “Single” will appear in the View field. The “Single” view when selected shows only the spots for the selected advertiser, as shown below. The spot time, line number and length are shown for each spot.</span></li>

 <li class="rvps4"><span class="rvts11">Highlight</span><span class="rvts12">: When you click on a spot, certain characteristics will be highlighted. This field controls what will be highlighted</span></li>
 <li class="rvps4"><span class="rvts11">Same advt</span><span class="rvts12">: All the spots from the same advertiser will be highlighted. Spots from the same contract will be highlighted in pink and spots from the same advertiser but from a different contract will be highlighted in magenta.</span></li>
 <li class="rvps4"><span class="rvts11">Same Prot’n</span><span class="rvts12">: This will highlight all spots with the same Product Protection code.</span></li>

 <li class="rvps4"><span class="rvts11">Missed Area</span><span class="rvts12">: This determines what will be displayed in the Missed Area, which can display missed spots, manually scheduled contracts that spots can be created from, cancelled spots, and hidden spots.&nbsp;</span></li>
 <li class="rvps4"><span class="rvts11">Missed Reason</span><span class="rvts12">: This is the Missed Reason that will be assigned to a spot placed in the Missed Area or dragged onto a missed reason.</span></li>

</ul>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<h2 class="rvps8"><span class="rvts0"><span class="rvts31">Viewing Avails and Spots</span></span></h2>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">To view the avails and spots for a vehicle, select the vehicle from the dropdown in the upper left corner of the screen, then select the week to work in from the calendar dropdown by clicking the week on the calendar or by manually typing in a date.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">By default, the main section of the screen lists seven days across, with each day’s filled and unsold avails shown below the date in a grid. (There is also a daily view available that shows a single day view instead of a seven day view, and when the system is set to the “Radio Station” setting on the “System Used For” option in the Traffic Site Options-&gt;General tab, the Spots screen will default to the daily view.)</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">On the Spots screen, dates in the past appear in red. If the final log has been generated for a date in the future, the date will appear in magenta. If a date is in the future but the final log has not been generated for it yet, the date will appear in blue. If a day has no inventory defined for it, it will have a yellow background to distinguish it from days with inventory, which have a white background.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">In the grid area, the avail time and avail name appear above either a green unit/second open avail (when there is available inventory for the break), or a spot that shows the spot length, advertiser, product, and daypart.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">An example of a break with available inventory (in this example, 4 units or 120 seconds):</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><img alt="" style="padding : 1px;" src="lib/NewItem428.png"></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">The same break with a 30 second spot booked into it:</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><img alt="" style="padding : 1px;" src="lib/NewItem427.png"></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">A red dot to the left of a spot indicates that a comment is attached to the spot.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><img alt="" style="padding : 1px;" src="lib/NewItem426.png"></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">To view the comment, hold the right mouse button down when clicking on the spot. The comment appears in the yellow area, as shown in the example below.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><img alt="" style="padding : 1px;" src="lib/NewItem425.png"></p>
<h2 class="rvps8"><span class="rvts0"><span class="rvts52">Spot Color Coding</span></span></h2>
<ul style="text-indent: 0px; padding: 0; margin: 0 0 0 24px; list-style-position: outside; list-style-type: disc;">
 <li class="rvps4"><span class="rvts12">Any spot in black is a non-hidden line spot</span></li>
 <li class="rvps4"><span class="rvts12">Any spot in blue is from a hidden line of a package</span></li>
 <li class="rvps4"><span class="rvts12">Any spot in italics is a makegood</span></li>
 <li class="rvps4"><span class="rvts12">Any spot with a strikethrough is an outside</span></li>
 <li class="rvps4"><span class="rvts12">Additional color coding explanation appears when clicking the key icon</span></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="rvps8"><span class="rvts0"><span class="rvts31">Spot Information Pop-up box</span></span></h2>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">When mouse-clicking on a spot in the schedule area, the Missed Area, or the Work Area, the system will bring up a pop-up box that shows more detailed information about the contract the spot comes from in the upper left corner of the screen, as shown below. The system will also highlight other spots from the same contract and advertiser.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><img alt="" style="padding : 1px;" src="lib/NewItem424.png"></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">From this pop-up box, clicking the contract number (in the upper left corner) will open the contract on the Orders screen.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">To close the pop up box, either click the Close button or click the underlined spot a second time.</span></p>
<h4 class="rvps15"><span class="rvts0"><span class="rvts45">Ordered Package Vehicles on the Pop-up box</span></span></h4>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">If the spot selected is part of a package, you will see “Hidden” in the Package field on the Line Detail information. &nbsp;You can see the other vehicles that make up this package by clicking on the down arrow. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
<h2 class="rvps8"><span class="rvts0"><span class="rvts50">Ordered Days on the Pop-up box</span></span></h2>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">When the Calendar dropdown arrow is clicked on the Spot detail pop-up, a calendar will appear with green days for the valid schedule days, red days for days outside the ordered daypart, and blue days for days within the ordered date range but outside of the ordered daypart.</span></p>
<h2 class="rvps8"><span class="rvts0"><span class="rvts31">Missed Area</span></span></h2>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">The area in the lower right corner of the screen is called the Missed Area. By default, the Missed Area shows the missed spots for the vehicle/week selected. Spots may be in missed because of a variety of reasons: the week could have been closed at the time of scheduling; there might have been no available inventory to schedule into; product protection conflicts could have prevented the spot from scheduling into the available inventory; the spot could have been manually moved into Missed; plus numerous other reasons.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">The system defaults to showing you only those spots missed in the vehicle you are currently viewing.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">You can view all of the spots in the Missed Area individually on separate lines or by contract lines by clicking on the Spots/Contract toggle on the left side of the Missed Area.</span></p>
<h3 class="rvps11"><span class="rvts0"><span class="rvts34">Spots View</span></span></h3>
<p class="rvps2"><img alt="" style="padding : 1px;" src="lib/NewItem423.png"></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">The following information is shown for each spot:</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts32">Advertiser: </span><span class="rvts6">The advertiser abbreviation is used.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts32"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts32">Product name: </span><span class="rvts6">if defined.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">If the "Short Title" feature is used, then the Short Title is shown instead of the advertiser/product.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts32"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts32">Spot count:</span><span class="rvts6"> For weekly buys, it shows the number of spots per week. For example: "5/w" means 5 spots per week.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">For Daily buys, it shows a count of the allowed number of spots per week, with the letter "d" to indicate it's a daily buy. For example: "5/d" means it's a daily buy that allows for five spots in the week.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts32">Avail name:</span><span class="rvts6"> when a "book into" avail name is used, the "book into" avail name will be shown. If an "exclude" avail name is used, it will show "X-" followed by the abbreviated avail name.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts32">Valid days:</span><span class="rvts6"> For weekly buys, the valid days are shown for each of the seven days of the week starting with Monday, with the letter "y" indicating a valid day and the letter "n" indicating an invalid day, and with a capital letter used to indicate the missed day. For example, "yyyYynn" indicates Monday through Friday are valid days, the spot was missed on Thursday (the forth letter of the seven that are displayed), and that Saturday and Sunday are invalid days (the sixth and seventh letters). For daily buys, disallowed days are shown with a dash. For example, "mTw----" indicates Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday are valid days, Tuesday was the missed day, and Thursday through Sunday are not valid days.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">For sports spots, it shows the event number instead of the valid days. For example, E#13 indicates event number 13 for the season.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts32">Spot Length:</span><span class="rvts6"> the spot length in seconds.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts32">Daypart times: </span><span class="rvts6">from the ordered daypart.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts32">Missed day: </span><span class="rvts6">the mm/dd/yy date that the spot was missed on.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts32">Ordered vehicle and Pre-empt Makegood vehicle and date: </span><span class="rvts6">For makegood and outside spots that have been pre-empted, when viewed in the Missed Area (or Work Area), the spot will be flagged as a pre-empted spot with the words “PMG” followed by the vehicle it was pre-empted from, and the date it was pre-empted from.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">Note: missed spots shown in the Work Area use the same rules about what information is displayed for them that the Missed Area uses.</span></p>

<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">On the Contract view, the number of missed spots for that contract appears after the spot length.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">By clicking in the “Missed Area” dropdown near the top of the screen, you can change what appears in the Missed Area. The options are:</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<ul style="text-indent: 0px; padding: 0; margin: 0 0 0 24px; list-style-position: outside; list-style-type: disc;">
 <li style="margin-left: 0px; text-indent: 0px" class="rvps25"><span class="rvts6">Current Week: shows the missed spots for the vehicle displayed.</span></li>
 <li style="margin-left: 0px; text-indent: 0px" class="rvps25"><span class="rvts6">Current Month: shows the missed spots for the current month.</span></li>
 <li style="margin-left: 0px; text-indent: 0px" class="rvps25"><span class="rvts6">Past Month: shows the missed spots for previous month.</span></li>
 <li style="margin-left: 0px; text-indent: 0px" class="rvps25"><span class="rvts6">Advertiser: shows the missed spots for a selected advertiser.</span></li>
 <li style="margin-left: 0px; text-indent: 0px" class="rvps25"><span class="rvts6">Direct Response: Lists Direct Response contracts with a line for the selected vehicle and week. Drag from here to create Direct Response spots</span></li>
 <li style="margin-left: 0px; text-indent: 0px" class="rvps25"><span class="rvts6">Per Inquiry: Lists Per Inquiry contracts with a line for the selected vehicle and week. Drag from here to create Per Inquiry spots.</span></li>
 <li style="margin-left: 0px; text-indent: 0px" class="rvps25"><span class="rvts6">PSA: Lists PSA contracts with a line for the selected vehicle and week when PSA contracts are set to be manually scheduled (in Site Options). Drag from here to create PSA spots. When PSA contracts are set to be automatically scheduled, then the PSA option is not shown.</span></li>
 <li style="margin-left: 0px; text-indent: 0px" class="rvps25"><span class="rvts6">Promo: Lists Promo contracts with a line for the selected vehicle and week when Promo contracts are set to be manually scheduled (in Site Options). Drag from here to create Promo spots. When Promo contracts are set to be automatically scheduled, then the Promo option is not shown.</span></li>
 <li style="margin-left: 0px; text-indent: 0px" class="rvps25"><span class="rvts6">Remnant: Lists Remnant contracts with a line for the selected vehicle and week when Remnant contracts are set to be manually scheduled (in Site Options). Drag from here to create Remnant spots. When Remnant contracts are set to be automatically scheduled, then the Remnant option is not shown.</span></li>
 <li style="margin-left: 0px; text-indent: 0px" class="rvps25"><span class="rvts6">Cancelled by Date: displays cancelled spots.&nbsp;</span></li>
 <li style="margin-left: 0px; text-indent: 0px" class="rvps25"><span class="rvts6">Hidden by Date: displays hidden spots.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">If Sports vehicles are used and spots from non-sports vehicles are allowed to be moved to sports vehicles, when clicking the “Missed Area” dropdown, radio buttons will appear labeled Vehicle “Current” or “All” to allow the user to select either the current vehicle missed area or for all vehicles, which is used for moving missed spots from a sports vehicle to a non-sports vehicle.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">There are four ways to sort spots in the Missed Area: by Advertiser Name, Daypart (earliest to latest by contract line start time), Spot Length, or Spot Price (high to low). The default sort is by advertiser name.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">To change the sort, click the Sort button then select the sort option to use from the menu.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">In this example, the spots are sorted by price.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><img alt="" style="padding : 1px;" src="lib/NewItem421.png"></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">For makegood and outside spots that have been pre-empted, when viewed in the Missed Area (or Work Area), the spot will be flagged as a pre-empted spot with the words “PMG” followed by the vehicle it was pre-empted from, and the date it was pre-empted from.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">In this example, the HBO spot was ordered and booked in vehicle “George Carlin” on 12/26/15, then moved as a makegood/outside to vehicle “Billy Crystal” on 12/26/15, then pre-empted from that vehicle to Missed.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><img alt="" style="padding : 1px;" src="lib/NewItem420.png"></p>
<h3 class="rvps11"><span class="rvts0"><span class="rvts34">Manually Scheduled Contracts</span></span></h3>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">Some contract types are manually scheduled. Direct Response and Per Inquiry contract types are always manually scheduled. PSA, Promo, and Remnant contract types are configured in Site Options as manually scheduled or automatically scheduled. Manually scheduled contracts do not automatically schedule spots into avails. Spots must be created for them on the Spots screen.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">To create a spot from a manually scheduled contract:</span></p>
<ol style="text-indent: 0px; padding: 0; margin: 0 0 0 24px; list-style-position: outside;">
 <li class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">From the Missed Area dropdown near the top of the Spots screen, pick one of the manually scheduled contract types, such as Per Inquiry.</span></li>
 <li class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">This changes the Missed Area view in the lower right corner to display a list of contracts for the selected manually scheduled contract type with one or more lines for the selected vehicle and date.</span></li>
 <li class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">Click and hold the mouse button on one of the lines, then drag the spot to an avail and release the mouse button to create the spot.</span></li>
</ol>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">After creating the spot, the count of spots will increment as shown in the Missed Area. For example, in the picture below, it shows that 2 spots were ordered for the week and 1 was scheduled (1 of 2).</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><img alt="" style="padding : 1px;" src="lib/NewItem2371.png"></p>
<h2 class="rvps8"><span class="rvts0"><span class="rvts31">Work Area</span></span></h2>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">The Work Area appears in the lower left corner of the Spots screen (opposite the Missed Area). The Work Area is used to temporarily place spots that are being moved to another week or vehicle as makegood/outside spots.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">Example of spots in the Work Area. Pre-empted spots are shown with the words “PMG” followed by the vehicle and date it was pre-empted from.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><img alt="" style="padding : 1px;" src="lib/NewItem419.png"></p>
<h4 class="rvps15"><span class="rvts0"><span class="rvts45">Work Area Procedure</span></span></h4>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">To move spots to another week or vehicle, use the Work Area.</span></p>
<ul style="text-indent: 0px; padding: 0; margin: 0 0 0 24px; list-style-position: outside; list-style-type: disc;">
 <li class="rvps4"><span class="rvts12">First move the spot into the Work Area.</span></li>
 <li class="rvps4"><span class="rvts12">Change the vehicle and/or week as needed.</span></li>
 <li class="rvps4"><span class="rvts12">Move the spot from the Work Area into an avail.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="rvps22"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<h2 class="rvps8"><span class="rvts0"><span class="rvts31">Exiting the Spots screen and the Work Area</span></span></h2>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">If there are spots in the Work Area and the user presses Done to exit the Spots screen, the system will ask what to do with the spots in the Work Area. They can either be saved in the Work Area by pressing Save, moved to Missed by pressing Move, or the user can go back to the Spots screen by pressing Cancel.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><img alt="" style="padding : 1px;" src="lib/NewItem418.png"></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">If the spots are saved in the Work Area, the next time any user goes into the Spots screen, the saved Work Area spots will be present in the Work Area, from which they can be moved normally either into avails or into the Missed Area. Spots saved in the Work Area will appear as Missed when viewed on spot reports such as the Spot Placement report.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">The Work Area Save/Move/Cancel prompt will also appear when switching from a non-sports vehicle to a sports vehicle when there are spots in the Work Area, or when switching from a sports vehicle to a non-sports vehicle when there are spots in the Work Area, as the system does not allow spots to be moved from a sports vehicle to a non-sports vehicle (or vice versa) using the Work Area.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">Spots in the Work Area can also be placed in missed in the vehicle they were originally scheduled in by pressing the Clear button next to to the Work Area toggle near the top of the screen</span><a name="_Toc357595012"></a><span class="rvts6">.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<h2 class="rvps8"><span class="rvts0"><span class="rvts31">Other Work Area views</span></span></h2>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">The Work Area can also be changed to show the distribution of spots in a graph. To view the graphed information, first click a spot for an advertiser/contract you would like to view the distribution for, then click the “Work Area” toggle at the top of the screen. The following views are available:</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul style="text-indent: 0px; padding: 0; margin: 0 0 0 24px; list-style-position: outside; list-style-type: disc;">
 <li class="rvps2"><span class="rvts32">CntrSchd-Graph All Days:</span><span class="rvts6"> The Contract Rotation view shows a graph view of the spot rotation by day and hour for a selected spot</span></li>
 <li class="rvps2"><span class="rvts32">LineSchd-Graph Past Days:</span><span class="rvts6"> </span><a name="_Toc357595013"></a><span class="rvts6">The </span><span class="rvts6">Line Rotation view</span><span class="rvts6"> </span><span class="rvts6">illustrates the scheduling rotation information for the specific line of the specific spot that is selected&nbsp;</span></li>
 <li class="rvps2"><span class="rvts32">CntrAll-Graph All Days:</span><span class="rvts6"> </span><a name="_Toc357595014"></a><span class="rvts6">The </span><span class="rvts6">All Spots for a Contract view will display</span><span class="rvts6"> all the spots on all contracts for the selected advertiser&nbsp;</span><span class="rvts32"> &nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">You have the option to see this information for “All Days”, which displays all days for the entire contract span, or “Past Days”, which includes the week displayed in addition to dates in the past. The system defaults to showing “All Days”. To view “Past Days”, click the “All Days” toggle once.</span></p>
