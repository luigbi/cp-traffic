<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">Unlike Conventional Vehicles that are ordered by date, Sports Vehicles are ordered by an Event Schedule. This allows you to either order spots by Event, meaning a guaranteed number of spots will be placed in each game on the schedule, by Week, meaning a number of spots will air throughout the week but not necessarily in every game, or a mixture of both ways.</span></p>

 <li class="rvps4"><span class="rvts12"># Spots/Event: Enter the number of spots to air per Event.&nbsp;</span></li>
 <li class="rvps4"><span class="rvts12">Events by #: Select the span of Events that will be purchased. For example, if they are only purchasing the first 100 Events, enter 1-100 in the ‘Events by #’ box.</span></li>
 <li class="rvps4"><span class="rvts12">Events In/Out: If there is a pattern to your buy, such as the spots will air in every 3 Events then will be out of the following two Events, enter the pattern in the Events In and Out fields.</span></li>

<h2 class="rvps8"><span class="rvts0"><span class="rvts31">Modifying Spot Counts in the Past</span></span></h2>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">When the User Options setting "change contracts in past with unbilled spots" is set to green for the signed on user, they will be able to change the spot count for a sports event that is in the past, if the vehicle is unbilled for that month. For example, if 5 spots were ordered, and 4 aired, and the user wished to remove one of the spots from the order after airing but before billing, if their User Options permissions allow it, they can do that by simply changing the spot count on the sports event grid for that contract line on the order. (Version 7.1 and above only.) If that User Options setting is not checked on, spot counts for past sports events cannot be modified.</span></p>
<h2 class="rvps8"><span class="rvts0"><span class="rvts31">Schedule Lines</span></span></h2>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">Once you have ordered all of your spots and made any necessary alterations, click Done, and the total number of spots airing will show per week (regardless of whether you ordered your spots by Event or Week) on the schedule line on the main proposal/order screen.</span></p>

<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">Sports vehicles can be packaged together, or with other types of vehicles, such as Conventional or Selling. You can create a Dynamic package in the Proposal/Order screen unique to a particular client, or a Standard package in the Rate Card screen to be used on any proposal/order, the same way you would create a package that included Conventional vehicles only.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">When printing your proposal/order, you can choose whether to list the contents of the package, or show only the package line.</span></p>

<h2 class="rvps8"><span class="rvts0"><span class="rvts31">Modeling Sports Events to a New Contract</span></span></h2>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">When creating a new contract by modeling from an existing contract, on version 7.1 and above, sports events can also be modeled. On prior versions, only the sports vehicles/lines were modeled, not the actual events. On version 7.1 and above, there will be two options when modeling: “Retain line and events on and after date”, which will use the event numbers and new contract start date to determine which events should be copied to the new contract; and “Retain line, remove events”, which will work the way it worked on earlier versions, where the events are removed but the vehicle/line is retained.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">When copying the events to the new contract, the event number is used to determine which events should be modeled, allowing events in one season to be copied to a new contract for the same event numbers for the same or a different season. For example, if the original contract had events 1 through 5, on various dates of Season 2018, and it was used to model a new contract for season 2019, with a start date in 2019, then the new contract would also have events 1 through 5, but for the season 2019 dates. Events can also be modeled from one season to the same season, also using the event dates and the contract start date.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">To determine which season to use when copying events to a new contract, the system uses the new contract start date to find the earliest non-expired season. A non-expired season is a season where the season end date is after the contract start date – this prevents spots from seasons that have already ended from being copied to the new contract.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">Here are several examples of how this works. For these examples, the modeled from contract has spots for season 2019, which has a start date of 8/1/19 and an end date of 12/31/19, and there is also a season 2020 in existence, with a start date of 8/1/20. (There is also a 2018 and 2021 season.)</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">Example 1 - When the new contract start date is the same as the modeled from contract start date: If the new contract start date is 8/1/19, then the events and spot counts from the original contract will be copied to the 2019 season, starting from 8/1/19, because the 2019 season is the non-expired season with the earliest season start date when compared to the new contract start date. The 2018 season will not be used because it ended before the new contract start date. The 2020 and 2021 seasons will not be used because the 2019 season is the non-expired season with the earliest season start date.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">Example 2 – When the new contract start date is after the modeled from contract start date, but before the end of the modeled from contract season: If the new contract start date is 9/1/19, then the events and spot counts from the original contract will be copied to the 2019 season, starting from 9/1/19. (The event numbers will be used to determine which events to copy. For example, if the modeled from contract had 1 spot per event for events 1 through 10, and in the 2019 season, events 1 and 2 are prior to 9/1/19, then the new contract will have 1 spot for events 3 through 10.)</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">Example 3 – When the new contract start date is after the end of the modeled from contract season: If the new contract start date is 1/1/20, the events and spot counts from the original contract will be copied to the 2020 season, because the 2019 season expired on 12/31/19, and the non-expired season with the earliest start date is the 2020 season. The 2021 season will not be used because the 2020 season has an earlier start date.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">Note: this feature only copies events from one season per line. In the unusual circumstances in which a single line has spots for multiple seasons, only the first season gets copied.</span></p>
