<p class="rvps2"><img alt="" style="padding : 1px;" src="lib/NewItem27.png"></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts32">Payment Name and Address:</span><span class="rvts6"> This is the Remit To address that appears on the invoice.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts32">Default Billing Cycle Local, Regional and National:</span><span class="rvts6"> You can define a sales source as being Local, Regional, or National in the Sales Origin Field. This option will default the Billing Cycle that will appear in the Proposal and Orders Screens based on the salesperson’s setting. You can override the default on an order by order basis. You must have the Weekly and Calendar billing options checked to use this feature.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts32">Lowest Invoice Number to Assign, Highest Number to Assign, Next Number to Assign:</span><span class="rvts6"> Determines the invoice number range. The Next # to Assign needs to be defined during the initial setup, and will then update automatically during invoicing.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts32">Last Billed Date: Broadcast, Calendar, Weekly, Last Rep Print Date:</span><span class="rvts6"> These invoice dates need to be defined during the initial setup, and will then update automatically as needed during invoicing.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts32">Invoice All Contracts: </span><span class="rvts6">There are three methods of billing. Each method affects the invoices as well as the way in which receivables are updated. Once a method is selected, it cannot be changed. See Appendix A for complete descriptions of each method.</span></p>
<ul style="text-indent: 0px; padding: 0; margin: 0 0 0 24px; list-style-position: outside; list-style-type: disc;">
 <li style="margin-left: 0px" class="rvps20"><span class="rvts12">“As Ordered, Update Ordered Vehicle”: All dollars ordered will be billed as ordered including missed and moved spots, with revenue going to the ordered vehicle.</span></li>
 <li style="margin-left: 0px" class="rvps20"><span class="rvts12">“As Ordered, Update Aired Vehicle”: All dollars ordered will be billed including missed and moved spots with revenue going to the aired vehicle.</span></li>
 <li style="margin-left: 0px" class="rvps20"><span class="rvts12">“As Aired”: Spots will be billed based on where they aired, and all revenue moves with the spots.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="rvps22"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts32">As Ordered Missed Show Avail Times or Random</span><span class="rvts6">: When billing as ordered, this setting determines what is shown on the invoice for conventional line spots that were missed, made good, or set as outside.</span></p>
<ul style="text-indent: 0px; padding: 0; margin: 0 0 0 48px; list-style-position: outside; list-style-type: disc;">
 <li class="rvps4"><span class="rvts12">Avail Time: If the spot is a makegood or outside spot, it uses the makegood/outside date and time for the missed date and time. If the spot is missed, it generates a random date and time (same as the “random” option). This setting should only be used if all makegoods and outsides are only moved within the week it was originally missed in, and not to later or earlier weeks.</span></li>
 <li class="rvps4"><span class="rvts12">Random: A random date and time will be generated during the invoice process, within the allowed days and times from the order.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts32">Ordered Daypart Show Name, Time or None: </span><span class="rvts6">This setting is used to define what ordered daypart information will be displayed on invoice form 1 for non-overridden dayparts. This affects both conventional lines and package lines, and prints under the ordered vehicle name. The options are:</span></p>
<ul style="text-indent: 0px; padding: 0; margin: 0 0 0 48px; list-style-position: outside; list-style-type: disc;">
 <li class="rvps4"><span class="rvts12">Name: Prints the daypart name.</span></li>
 <li class="rvps4"><span class="rvts12">Time: Prints the daypart start and end times.</span></li>
 <li class="rvps4"><span class="rvts12">None: Only the vehicle name is shown. The daypart name and daypart times are not shown.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="rvps10"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts32">BBs on Same Line</span><span class="rvts6">: &nbsp;If checked on, a separate invoice line will be created for Open Billboards, the ordered spot, and Closing Billboards. This may create lengthy invoice runs.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts32">For ISCI Truncate Right, Truncate Left, Wrap Around:</span><span class="rvts6"> These settings determine how lengthy ISCI codes are handled on the invoice. “Truncate right” will remove the last characters of the ISCI if it exceeds the column space. “Truncate left” will remove the first few characters of the ISCI if it exceeds the column space. “Wrap Around” will show the entire text across more than one line.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts32">All Vehicles on Same Invoice:</span><span class="rvts6"> If set to Yes, this will print all vehicles on one invoice; if No, a separate invoice will print for every vehicle on a contract.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts32">Combine Air and NTR: </span><span class="rvts6">This will combine Air Time and NTR on one invoice. If using Installment Billing, this option is automatically activated. Note that if an invoice contains both air time and NTR, and electronic invoicing is used for the agency, that invoice will be excluded from the generated EDI file, as NTR is not compatible with electronic invoicing. (On version 8.1 and above, “Air” in “Combine Air and NTR” has been renamed “Commercial”.)</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts32">Invoice Selective Vehicles: </span><span class="rvts6">When checked, each vehicle is listed in the Invoice Screen and can be selected and invoiced individually. This option can only be used if “All Vehicles on Same Invoice” is selected.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts32">Laser Print Form (1) Ordered/Aired/Reconc Columns: </span><span class="rvts6">Typically Invoice form 1 is used with “Sort by Sales Source” selected. This is the default and most commonly used form. It shows ordered information from the contract, reconciled aired information, and calculates the difference.</span></p>
<ul style="text-indent: 0px; padding: 0; margin: 0 0 0 48px; list-style-position: outside; list-style-type: disc;">
 <li class="rvps4"><span class="rvts12">If Suppress Air Time is selected, no spot air times will print.</span></li>
 <li class="rvps4"><span class="rvts12">Sort by Sales Source: This applies to Form #1 only. If checked, the major invoice sort will be by Sales Source, with the invoice payee as a minor sort.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="rvps10"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts32">Laser Print Form (2) Separate Invoice/Affidavit:</span><span class="rvts6"> This form shows Totals for each Market. &nbsp;A separate Affidavit of Performance Report will show the detail spot information that can be provided to your client with the invoice. To enable this format, “Market Based” must be activated in Site Options-&gt;Sales.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts32">Laser Print Form (3) Aired Column</span><span class="rvts6">: This form only shows the aired spots and does not have an Ordered or Reconciled column on the invoice format.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts32">Laser Print Form (4) 3-Col Aired:</span><span class="rvts6"> This format shows aired spots only and does not have an Ordered or Reconciled column. &nbsp;The aired spots show in three columns that will fit more airing spots per invoice than the other invoice formats. No Makegood or Outside spots, missed spots or line comments are shown. This form cannot combine NTR.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts32">Tax Region None, USA, Canadian, Air Time Tax, NTR Tax: </span><span class="rvts6">If applicable, select what country tax is used, whether the tax is for Air Time spots, NTR, or both, and define name for Tax 1 and Tax 2 (if used) for example: AZ, NM, HI. (Note: on version 8.1 and above, “Air Time Tax” is renamed “Commercial Tax”.)</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts32">Print Rep Invoices by Market or Vehicle: </span><span class="rvts6">If using Rep vehicles, determine whether you wish to print Rep Invoices by Market (vehicle group) or by individual vehicles.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts32">Post Rep by Date/Time, and/or Counts by Std, Cal, Wkly, or None: </span><span class="rvts6">This determines how rep spots are posted.</span></p>
<ul style="text-indent: 0px; padding: 0; margin: 0 0 0 48px; list-style-position: outside; list-style-type: disc;">
 <li class="rvps4"><span class="rvts12">Post Rep by Date/Time and/or Counts: Allows you to post the exact dates and times each rep spot aired.</span></li>
 <li class="rvps4"><span class="rvts12">Std: Standard broadcast calendar.</span></li>
 <li class="rvps4"><span class="rvts12">Cal: Calendar month.</span></li>
 <li class="rvps4"><span class="rvts12">Wkly: Weekly. When this option is selected, when posting rep counts by vehicle, a “Station Invoice Number” field is shown on the Post Log screen that can be used to enter a station invoice number, which will appear on the Barter Payment report and Barter Payment export.</span></li>
 <li class="rvps4"><span class="rvts12">None.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts32">Sort by Payee or Vehicle: </span><span class="rvts6">Typically, invoices are sorted alphabetically by payee. If the Invoice Selective Vehicles option is activated, this question gives you the choice of sorting by vehicle instead of agency.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts32">Lock Box by Vehicle Instead of Payee:</span><span class="rvts6"> This is used if your vehicles are stations and invoices are remitted to the stations, not corporate headquarters. When selected, each vehicle must have an address defined in Lists-&gt;Vehicles.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts32">Day is Complete Testing: </span><span class="rvts6">If checked, Monday through Sunday check boxes appear in Post Log. Each day must be checked as Complete for each vehicle prior to running invoices.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts32"># Lines to Skip: Above Log and Between Logo and Address:</span><span class="rvts6"> A standard #10 window envelope can be used to mail out the invoices. These questions are used to adjust the number of spaces on the invoice form to fit into the window. The allowable numbers are between 0 and 5.</span><span class="rvts100"> </span><span class="rvts6">Start with 0 before and 3 between logo and address, then adjust from there after testing a preliminary invoice to determine the correct values for your printer.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts32">Change Invoice Spot Times to ET, CT, MT, PT or N/A: </span><span class="rvts6">Typically N/A is selected. This is used if your programming is defined in a time zone different from what needs to appear on the invoices. This setting also affects the Proposal XML export (start and end time) and the Proposals/Contracts and Insertion Orders report.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts32"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts32">Print Final EDI Invoices: </span><span class="rvts6">When checked, by default, the “Include EDI” checkbox on the invoice screen will be checked on so that invoices for agencies that are set to use the EDI system will also get regular invoices created for them.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts32">Bill Spots X-Mid in Aired Month: </span><span class="rvts6">If checked and using EDI, then spots that cross midnight on the last day of the standard billing month will print on the invoice in the order month with a notation that they aired after midnight, but will actually bill in the next month where they truly aired. If unchecked then the spots will be shown and billed in the ordered month.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts32">Require Complete Station Posting Prior to Agency Invoices</span><span class="rvts6">: This setting is only for systems that have vehicles set to the "Post Log Import Source" of "Radio Station Invoice" on the Vehicle Options-&gt;Barter tab. If the "Require Complete Station Posting Prior to Agency Invoices" setting is checked on, then all radio station invoices must be posted (either by importing the PDF invoices or by manually posting them on the Post Log screen) before final invoices can be run from the Traffic system. If the "Require Complete Station Posting Prior to Agency Invoices" is not checked on, then final invoices can be generated before all the radio station invoices have been imported for the month. The default setting for this option is for it be unchecked. It should be left unchecked for all systems except in the case of systems that use the radio station invoice import feature and that do not wish to allow final invoices to be generated before all radio station invoices have been imported into the Traffic system.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts32"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts32">Invoice Email: Activate and Automatic: </span><span class="rvts6">These settings affect the PDF Invoice Email feature. When “Activate” is not checked, then PDF Invoice Emails will never be created or sent, regardless of what the "Automatic" checkbox is set to. When “Activate” is checked, the “Automatic” setting is used to determine what happens with the PDF invoices.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">Automatic settings (note: these settings only take effect when “Activate” is checked on):&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<ul style="text-indent: 0px; padding: 0; margin: 0 0 0 48px; list-style-position: outside; list-style-type: disc;">
 <li class="rvps4"><span class="rvts12">When “Automatic” is not checked, the PDF invoice email files are created during the final invoice process for any agency or direct advertiser set to the PDF email setting in the EDI for Invoices field (on the agency and advertiser list screen). The PDF invoice emails must be manually emailed to the agencies/direct advertisers as needed, outside of the Traffic system. When generating reprint invoices, a prompt will appear that asks about the PDF invoice emails. When pressing Yes, the PDF invoice email files will be created. When pressing No, the PDF invoice email files will not be created.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="rvps10"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<ul style="text-indent: 0px; padding: 0; margin: 0 0 0 48px; list-style-position: outside; list-style-type: disc;">
 <li class="rvps4"><span class="rvts12">When “Automatic” is checked, PDF invoice emails will be created and emailed automatically, using the email addresses defined for each PDF email agency on the agency or advertiser (for direct advertisers) list screen. Which invoices are sent is determined by the “air time and NTR”, “air time only” and “NTR only” radio buttons. If “air time and NTR” is checked, then PDF invoice emails include air time and NTR invoices. If the Site Options setting “combine air time and NTR” is checked on, then the “air time and NTR” radio button is the only available radio button for this setting. If “combine air and NTR” is not checked on, meaning there are separate air time invoices and separate NTR invoices, even when there’s air time and NTR on a single contract, then the “air time only” and “NTR only” radio buttons will become available, to make it so that the PDF emails are only sent for air time invoices (not NTR), or only sent for NTR invoices (not air time). Additionally, when “automatic” is checked on, during the reprint invoice process, a prompt will appear that asks whether the PDF invoice emails should be emailed. When pressing Yes, the PDF invoice email files will be created and emailed to the recipients specified on the agency/direct advertiser screen. When pressing No on the prompt, the PDF invoice email files will not be created and will not be emailed.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>

For example, if the impression goal was 50,000, and 60,000 were achieved, a maximum of 50,000 impressions would be invoiced. When “Bill Over-Delivered CPM Impressions” is checked on, then impressions that are achieved that are greater than the impression goal for the line will also be invoiced. For example, if the impression goal was 100,000, and 120,000 impressions were achieved, the full 120,000 impressions would be invoiced and the advertiser/agency would be charged for the 120,000 impressions.</span></p>
